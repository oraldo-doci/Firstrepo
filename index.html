                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <p> The main goal is to learn a serious profession that I am passionate about so I can devote my life to it. I would love to be part of something special and make an impact in these modern times where coding is more important than ever. Make some friends who are interested in coding to make the learning experience easier and more fun by sharing ideas and solving problems together. My dream would be to become a good game developer.
