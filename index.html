            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Oraldo Doçi and I am 24 years old, born and raised in a small city called Laç in Albania. My family is a small one, there is only me my 2 parents and my older brother. On november 2015 I immigrated to Italy where I got married and built my new family. People that know me usually describe me as a friendly, shy, and compassionate person. My main hobbies are traveling and playing online videogames.

                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <p> The main goal is to learn a serious profession that I am passionate about so I can devote my life to it. I would love to be part of something special and make an impact in these modern times where coding is more important than ever. Make some friends who are interested in coding to make the learning experience easier and more fun by sharing ideas and solving problems together. My dream would be to become a good game developer.
            </p>

                <h2>Why!!</h2>    
                 <ol>
                <li>I am the type of person that likes to use logic and figure out how things work from the most basic elements. That's why I think learning coding would be a good idea. 
                    <li>After consulting a really good developer that has worked for important companies I was guaranteed that the talent garden Codemasters was legit. </li>
                    <li>I need right now to give a direction to my life and I think talent garden is the best opportunity for me to learn, grow, and achieve something.</li>
